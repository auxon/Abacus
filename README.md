# Project Plan - Updated 2024-03-09.  

To simplify the implementation plan for the features outlined for Abacus, a decentralized software development network built on Bitcoin SV, we can organize the tasks into several core areas. This approach will help in focusing development efforts, managing complexity, and ensuring a comprehensive coverage of the system's goals.

### 1. Core Blockchain Integration
- **Merge Mining with Bitcoin SV:** Research and implement the technical details of merge mining to secure Abacus with the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Immutable History via Blockchain Transactions:** Design and implement the structure for storing development activities as transactions on the blockchain.

### 2. Development Tools and Infrastructure
- **Peer-to-Peer Source Control System:** Develop a decentralized version control system that operates over a peer-to-peer network.
- **Versioning Management:** Create mechanisms for version control and dependency management that leverage blockchain immutability.
- **Copyright and Royalties Management:** Implement smart contracts or similar constructs to automate copyright claims and royalty payments to contributors.

### 3. Advanced Development Features
- **Code Completion and Search:** Integrate or develop advanced machine learning algorithms for code suggestion and intelligent search functionalities.
- **Simulation Environments:** Build simulation environments for DNA computing, quantum computing, and other emerging technologies.

### 4. Security Features
- **Malware and Virus Protection:** Develop a next-generation security system using machine learning to detect and protect against malicious code.
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation:** Implement cryptographic protocols like bulletproofs, z-snarks, and homomorphic encryption for protecting critical code and data.

### 5. Node Operations and Mining Rewards
- **Node Types Specification:** Define the roles and functionalities of different node types (e.g., storage, runtime, test execution, machine learning).
- **Mining Rewards System:** Design and implement the rewards system for various contributions, including code, documentation, and node operation.

### 6. Community and Governance
- **Contribution and Governance Models:** Establish clear guidelines for contributions, governance, and decision-making processes within the Abacus network.
- **Localization & Globalization:** Ensure tools and platforms support internationalization, allowing for global participation and use.

### 7. Project Management and Milestones
- **Pre-Alpha to Alpha Transition:** Outline the key deliverables, quality assurance measures, and community engagement plans for transitioning from pre-alpha to alpha.
- **Alpha to Full Release Roadmap:** Develop a detailed roadmap from alpha release to the full 1.0 release, including milestones, beta testing phases, and user feedback loops.

### Implementation Approach
- **Iterative Development:** Adopt an agile methodology, allowing for iterative development, testing, and feedback at each stage.
- **Community Involvement:** Engage with the developer community early and often to gather feedback, contributions, and to foster a collaborative ecosystem.
- **Security and Scalability First:** Prioritize security and scalability in the design and development phases to ensure the network can handle growth and resist attacks.

By structuring the development plan into these focused areas, the Abacus team can tackle the complexity of building a comprehensive decentralized development environment while ensuring that each component integrates seamlessly to fulfill the project's ambitious goals.
